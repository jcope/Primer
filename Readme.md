## Prime Symmetry Theory

This repository contains software to support research for [Prime Symmetry Theory](http://primesymmetrytheory.com).
The code is maintained by the author, Jeremy B. Cope, and is provided for
verification and further research.

### Theory
Observations of symmetric patterns in binary representations of prime numbers.

Abstract: *The set of prime numbers can be categorized into subsets based on binary symmetric properties; these properties and subsets are defined, analyzed, and submitted for review.*
